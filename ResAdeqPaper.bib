abstract = {Conventionally, droop control has been used for primary frequency control, allowing generators to share imbalances in generation and load. This paper proposes the use of different types of droop-based control logics for load regulation to turn on or off groups of loads to help restore the system power balance. The proposed droop-based controllers are used by an aggregator to identify individual loads that can be used for demand response (DR) and control them according to their assigned priority. This procedure incorporates an incentive provided by the utility to the customer to allow control of their loads. Also, we will show that droop control can be used on a variety of resources in an MG at the same time, including energy storage system (ESS), generator, and loads to cooperatively contribute to frequency stabilization. Numerical experiments presented show that the proposed method is an effective way to prevent large frequency deviations due to variations in renewable generation and power contingencies in islanded MGs. {\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE.},

abstract = {—We examine the robustness of solar capacity-value estimates to three important data issues. The first is the sensitivity to using hourly averaged as opposed to subhourly solar-insolation data. The second is the sensitivity to errors in recording and interpreting load data. The third is the sensitivity to using modeled as opposed to measured solar-insolation data. We demonstrate that capacity-value estimates of solar are sensitive to all three of these factors, with potentially large errors in the capacity-value estimate in a particular year. If multiple years of data are available, the biases introduced by using hourly averaged solar-insolation can be smoothed out. Multiple years of data will not necessarily address the other data-related issues that we examine. Our analysis calls into question the accuracy of a number of solar capacity-value estimates relying exclusively on modeled solar-insolation data that are reported in the literature (includ-ing our own previous works). Our analysis also suggests that multiple years' historical data should be used for remunerating solar generators for their capacity value in organized wholesale electricity markets.

The increase in the penetration of wind generation in recent years has led to a number of challenges for the planning and operation of power systems. A key metric for generation system adequacy is the capacity value of generation. The capacity value of a generator is the contribution that a given generator makes to generation system adequacy. The variable and stochastic nature of wind sets it apart from conventional energy sources. As a result, the modeling of wind generation in the same manner as conventional generation for capacity value calculations is inappropriate. In this paper a preferred method for calculation of the capacity value of wind is described and a discussion of the pertinent issues surrounding it is given. Approximate methods for the calculation are also described with their limitations highlighted.

abstract = {The penetration of solar photovoltaic (PV) generation is increasing in many countries, with significant implications for the adequacy and operation of power systems. This work considers the Nord bidding zone within Italy, which hosts 7.7 GW of PV and almost no wind power. We simulate the implications of different PV penetration levels on the need for firm generation capacity and on ramping requirements over one to several hours. We compare ten years of synthetic hourly PV generation series derived from CM-SAF SARAH satellite data and observed load. The analysis also provides insights into the storage capacity required to smooth residual load over different time horizons. Results show that without storage (i) the penetration of PV in the region does not sensibly reduce the need for firm generation; (ii) the marginal contribution of PV to meet power demand decreases with its penetration; and (iii) high penetrations lead to larger and more frequent ramps, although extreme ramp rates do not last more than 1 h. The availability of storage significantly alters these results, but large storage capacities are required. Smoothing net load by a few hours requires 2–7 GWh of storage per GW of PV installed.},

abstract = {An important issue for electricity system operators is the estimation of renewables' capacity contributions to reliably meeting system demand, or their capacity value. While the capacity value of thermal generation can be estimated easily, assessment of wind and solar requires a more nuanced approach due to the resource variability. Reliability-based methods, particularly assessment of the Effective Load-Carrying Capacity, are considered to be the most robust and widely-accepted techniques for addressing this resource variability. This report compares estimates of solar PV capacity value by the Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) capacity expansion model against two sources. The first comparison is against values published by utilities or other entities for known electrical systems at existing solar penetration levels. The second comparison is against a time-series ELCC simulation tool for high renewable penetration scenarios in the Western Interconnection. Results from the ReEDS model are found to compare well with both comparisons, despite being resolved at a super-hourly temporal resolution. Two results are relevant for other capacity-based models that use a super-hourly resolution to model solar capacity value. First, solar capacity value should not be parameterized as a static value, but must decay with increasing penetration. This is because—for an afternoon-peaking system—as solar penetration increases, the system's peak net load shifts to later in the day-- when solar output is lower. Second, long-term planning models should determine system adequacy requirements in each time period in order to approximate LOLP calculations. Within the ReEDS model we resolve these issues by using a capacity value estimate that varies by time-slice. Within each time period the net load and shadow price on ReEDS's planning reserve constraint signals the relative importance of additional firm capacity.},

abstract = {Demand response (DR) and electrical energy storage (EES) are key attributes within the context of smarter and more sustainable power systems. However, little work has so far systematically investigated the reliability implications of deploying DR and EES at the system level, including the impacts of characteristics such as the energy payback and flexibility of DR or the capacity and efficiency of EES. Nevertheless, this is fundamental to address the questions as to how DR and EES affect system reliability and whether and to what extent they could displace generation capacity while maintaining sufficient system adequacy. Therefore, this paper aims at developing a general framework to evaluate the contribution of DR and EES to adequacy of supply by specifically modelling and analysing their operational flexibility parameters and constraints. Specific studies are run using sequential Monte Carlo simulation that allows capturing the relevant inter-temporal constraints. The results suggest that, given a prevailing generation portfolio, DR and EES could reduce the frequency and cumulative duration of interruptions, although these might become more severe. The amount of generation that could be displaced is then quantified, which is found to be less than the peak reduction provided by DR and EES while preserving system adequacy. The models and findings of this work are thus critical to quantitatively inform the energy policy debates about the potential of DR and EES to provide system capacity and participate in relevant markets.},

Our method uses a dynamic program to model the effect of power system outages on the operation and state of charge of storage in subsequent periods. We combine the optimized dispatch from the dynamic program with estimated system loss of load probabilities to compute a probability distribution for the state of charge of storage in each period. This probability distribution can be used as a forced outage rate for storage in standard reliability-based capacity value estimation methods. Our proposed method has the advantage over existing approximations that it explicitly captures the effect of system shortage events on the state of charge of storage in subsequent periods. We also use a numerical case study, based on five utility systems in the U.S., to demonstrate our technique and compare it to existing approximation methods.},

abstract = {The use of electrical energy storage (EES) and demand response (DR) to support system capacity is attracting increasing attention. However, little work has been done to investigate the capability of EES/DR to displace generation while providing prescribed levels of system reliability. In this context, this study extends the generation-oriented conceptofcapacitycredit (CC)toEES/DR, with theaim of assessing their contribution to adequacy of supply. A comprehensive framework and relevant numerical algorithms are proposed for the evaluation of EES/DR CC, with different ‘traditional' generation-oriented CC metrics being extended and a new CC metric defined to formally quantify the capability of EES/DR to displace conventional generation for different applications (system expansion, reliability increase etc.). In particular, specific technology-agnostic models have been developed to illustrate the implications of energy capacity, power ratings, and efficiency of EES, as well as payback characteristics and customer flexibility (that often also depend on different forms of storage available to customers) of DR. Case studies are performed on the IEEE RTS to demonstrate how the different characteristics of EES/DR can impact on their CC. The framework developed can thus support the important debates on the role of EES/DR for smart grid planning and market development. 1},

abstract = {Understanding the contribution a resource can make to the power system could indicate where its value lies. This paper estimates the capacity value of a load-shifting resource which is capable of providing multiple services. The capacity value represents the contribution of a resource to generation adequacy and an understanding of this contribution is important to compare how different power system resources can assist power system operators and planners. Additionally, policy-makers and market operators need an appreciation of the capacity value of different resources in order to design capacity remuneration mechanisms. A building energy model coupled with a power system model, co-optimizing the supply-side and the demand-side, is employed in this paper to estimate the capacity value of a specific load-shifting resource. The resource examined is electric thermal storage heating devices for space and water heating. Ireland is used as a test case. It was found that these load-shifting devices can provide an adequacy contribution to the power system and thus have a capacity value. The capacity value, for the Irish case, can be up to 26{\%} for the DR resource in question for the given year but the values are typically much lower due to operational constraints (reserve provision) and due to occupancy profile impacts. The results highlight the need for holistic modeling of demand response resources, as well as the need for additional work for different load-shifting resources and more data.},

With the worldwide increase in wind power during the past several years, there is increasing interest and significance regarding its capacity value because this has a direct influence on the amount of other (nonwind) capacity that is needed.

We also provide examples that explore the use of alternative reliability metrics for wind capacity value calculations. We show how multiple-year data sets significantly increase the robustness of results compared to single-year assessments. Assumptions regarding the transmission interconnections play a significant role. To date, results regarding which reliability metric to use for probabilistic capacity valuation show little sensitivity to the metric.

This paper surveys the existing probability theory of assessment of the capacity value of additional generation, and discusses the available statistical estimation methods for risk measures which depend on the joint distribution of demand and available additional capacity (with particular reference to wind). Preliminary results are presented on assessment of sampling uncertainty in hindcast LOLE and capacity value calculations, using bootstrap resampling. These results indicate strongly that, if the hindcast calculation is dominated by extremes of demand minus wind, there is very large sampling uncertainty in the results due to very limited historic experience of high demands coincident with poor wind resource. For meaningful calculations, some form of statistical smoothing will therefore be required in distribution estimation.},

Conclusion: Preliminary results have been presented on assessing sampling uncertainty in hindcast LOLE and capacity value calculations while using bootstrap resampling. Not realistic enough to quantitatively assess risk study for the Great Britain system.
